# 🇮🇳 Smart India Hackathon – Project

Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a nationwide initiative that gives students a platform to solve real-world problems and build innovative, scalable solutions for India. It encourages a strong culture of product innovation and nurtures a problem-solving mindset among young engineers.

This repository contains the source code and related resources for our Smart India Hackathon project, implemented in C++.

## 🌟 About Smart India Hackathon

- SIH brings together students from engineering and other disciplines to work on real problem statements from government bodies, industry, and NGOs.  
- The most recent edition saw participation from over 5 million students across the country, competing at 35+ locations for the top prizes.  
- Participants get a chance to work closely with private and public sector organizations, designing practical solutions and showcasing their skills to potential recruiters.

***

## 🎯 Project Overview

Briefly describe your specific project here, for example:

- The problem statement you are solving.  
- Who the end users are (citizens, government departments, enterprises, etc.).  
- What your solution does at a high level (web app, embedded system, analytics dashboard, automation tool, etc.).  

Example (replace with your own):

> This project focuses on building an efficient and user-friendly system to <your problem statement>, helping <target users> to <key benefit> using a C++ based backend and optimized algorithms.

***

## 🧩 Key Features

- Clearly defined problem statement mapped to SIH guidelines.  
- Robust C++ implementation focused on performance and reliability.  
- Modular code structure to make extension and maintenance easier.  
- Designed with real-world constraints and deployment scenarios in mind.  

(Add more bullets specific to your solution once the implementation is finalized.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++  
- Tools/IDE: (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Qt Creator, etc.)  
- Build System: (e.g., CMake/Makefile)  
- Other dependencies/libraries: (list here if used)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Describe how someone can build and run your project.

1) Clone the repository  
- git clone https://github.com/AniketFasate27/Smart-India-Hackathon.git  
- cd Smart-India-Hackathon  

2) Build the project  
- Mention the build command (e.g., using CMake or g++).  

3) Run the application  
- Show example commands or inputs if applicable.  

***

## 📌 Project Structure

Give a short overview of how the code is organized, for example:

- src/ – main C++ source files  
- include/ – header files (if any)  
- docs/ – problem statement, design notes, diagrams  
- test/ – test cases or sample inputs (if available)  

(Adjust these to match your actual structure.)

***

## 🧭 Future Improvements

- Add more robust error handling and edge-case coverage.  
- Optimize algorithms for larger input sizes or real-time constraints.  
- Integrate with UI / web / mobile front-end if required.  
- Add automated testing and CI pipeline.  

(Modify this list based on your roadmap.)
